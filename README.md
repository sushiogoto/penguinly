## Group Activity Organizing Simplified  ##

## Summary ##
  A web app to help take the pain out of organizing group activities and trips. Organize and collaborate your group activities in one location, vote on activities to everyone gets a say on what you're doing together!

## Problem ##
  Organizing activities can be a real pain. They're really an exercise in mass compromising - people end up doing things they don't really want to do, or have to skip the season finale of survivor because, apparently, nobody else in your group knows that the show is still running. Using chat apps to organize events is too disorganized, and having to scroll through all the hilarious text everyone's written since agreeing on the activity can induce carpal thumbnell syndrome. FaceBook events are too final and aren't ideal forums for a discussion.

## Solution ##
  Enter penguinly. You can suggest activities to do with your friends, who can all vote on the activity in question (including specifics, like time and location). Friends get notifications when activities have been suggested, so they'll know their input is needed. Too many unanswered notifications may result in removal from the tribe. Sorry buddy, the tribe has spoken.

## Quote from You ##

## Customer Quote ##
  "I didn't see my friends for years after I injured my thumb from the constant scrolling through chats to find details about things we were doing together - ever since I started using penguinly, I've started hanging out with my buddies more again. I think my cats are jealous."
